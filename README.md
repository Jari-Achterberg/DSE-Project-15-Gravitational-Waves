Short description on how to set-up Pycharm with this Github repository
1. Install Pycharm (you have different versions, I would suggest downloading the community edition)
2. Open Pycharm and click 'Checkout from version control' --> 'Git'
3. Copy the URL from the Github repository and click 'clone repository'
4. The project should now be opened in Pycharm (it might take a while)
5. I'll explain later how to create files and pull/push/merge (this README file should be in there already)
6. add something
