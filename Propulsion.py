# Determine what type of propulsion system is suitable for which manoeuvre

# Chemical propulsion (impulsive manoeuvres)
# - circularisation
# - 80km corrections?
# - phase shift towards constellation
# - realignment
# - End Of Life manoeuvre

# Electric propulsion (non-impulsive manoeuvres)
# - 80km corrections?
# - realignment?
# - orbit maintenances
# - End Of Life manoeuvre
